## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts Terraform scripts that automatically set up a Protection Level 2 (PL2) High Performance Computing (HPC) environment in Amazon Web Services (AWS) for researchers working with secure big data. This environment is in use at UC Berkeley and is one of Berkeley Research Computing's Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions for researchers working with protected data.

Before beginning, it is recommended that you review the [PL2 AWS Setup - Generalized Cost Estimator for HPC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VL2TNQnx3wHRkHMnyBUlrT7jW5uFZfDGXvzLvSkOSPw/edit?usp=sharing) which projects expenses for a setup like this. If at any point you need assistance or would like to consult with our team on your project, please feel free to email the [BRC Consulting team](mailto:research-it-consulting@berkeley.edu). This guide is intended for the systems or security administrator of a project to use to build the setup. Finally, if you're interested in looking at and understanding this project's code, start with `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`, and `variables.tf` -- the [recommended minimal module files](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/create.html#standard-module-structure) -- and work your way from there.

**If at any point you run into any issues, have a question, a special use case, or need additional clarification and documentation, feel free to [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kmishra9/PL2-AWS-Setup/issues) and we'll do our best to handle it.**

---

## Getting Started

1. The first thing you'll need to do is [Set up AWS Invoicing at UC Berkeley](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cDSv0EzEkl09FVYivsTtvel1vyenoFJCDQTiECbGqT4/edit?usp=sharing).
  - **Note**: For researchers at other institutions, this involves simply setting up an AWS account with billing -- if your instituion has a particular method of AWS invoicing, it is recommended that you get that set up.
  - **Note**: At this point, ensure that the root AWS account is attached to a [Special Purpose Account (SPA)](https://calnetweb.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/special-purpose-accounts-spa), or for non-Berkeley folks, a project-specific email. This is to ensure there is a a central point of administration, helps with the separation of permissions, and ensures project's longevity is not tied to any one individual's account.
    - **Example**: `bcht-aws@berkeley.edu` or `brc-aws-dev@berkeley.edu`

2. Once you have created a SPA account, ensure you are able to [log into it](https://calnetweb.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/special-purpose-accounts-spa/log-spa) in an Incognito window.
  - From within your SPA, check out [bmail.berkeley.edu](bmail.berkeley.edu) and your SPA's [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
  - From within your SPA, make a copy of this [PL2 AWS Setup - Documentation Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzAM7vR4AbKNYL_YJ6qL6J2hG3W9ePVI67BPIZvl8RU/edit?usp=sharing), which is part of the recommended workflow for this project.
    - **Note**: As you proceed through the setup, this is a "one-stop-shop" for documenting pieces of the project that you have control over (such as usernames, passwords, public keys, etc.) that will be readily accessible and shareable among project members. This is useful from a systems administrator perspective and from a security audit perspective as well.
    - **Note**: You should share this document with anybody involved with the project but be careful with who has access because this document will contain sensitive information. Any researcher or administrator should definitely have read+write access but you should share with individual emails only (including your own, as you'll be responsible for filling it out), rather than sharing it as a link.

3. Next, log into using the services tab from your root account's AWS console, go to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) console. You will need to complete a set of 5 security tasks that are good practices for securing your root account, visible on the bottom of the dashboard. The 5 tasks are:
  - **Delete your root access keys** -- this is to ensure no program or person can use the root account key credentials to authenticate and thus makes [controlling access to the account much easier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html). Follow the steps on the dashboard.
  - **Activate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on your root account** -- this is to ensure that only the systems/security administrator has access to the root account. Follow the steps on the dashboard.
  - **Create individual IAM users** -- for now we only need to create a single IAM user to get Terraform set up. Once Terraform builds the setup, each researcher will be assigned their own individual IAM user automatically. Follow the [AWS documentation on Creating an Administrator IAM User and Group (Console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html). Once the user has been  created, be sure to use the `Download .csv` button to download this IAM user's credentials.
    - **Note**: you should name this user "Terraform" rather than "Administrator" for additional clarity. The group it is added should still be named "Administrators".
    - **Note**: at Step 4, rather than enable "Console access" and specify a password, you should check the box to enable "Programmatic access"
    - **Note**: if you don't download the IAM user's credentials immediately after creating them, they won't be available for download later. Instead, you would need to [Create a new Access Key](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/).
  - **Use Groups to assign permissions** -- ignore this for now -- Terraform will help us create IAM groups for researcher, administrators, and log analysts
  - **Apply an IAM Password Policy** -- ignore this for now -- Terraform will set this up to ensure that the passwords required to access the console by the researchers and admin are appropriately secure against standard brute-force and dictionary attacks.

4. Once you've done this, open your copy of the `PL2 AWS Setup - Documentation Template` and fill in the yellow-highlighted items in the document (some can be filled in now, others you should fill in as you work through the rest of the setup). As you fill these pieces in, unhighlight the sections.
  - **Note**: Make sure to document the Terraform IAM credentials you downloaded earlier!
  - **Note**: You should hyperlink [Account ID: <123456789012>]() so it looks like what appears here, where you replace the <Account ID> with your own and link to your organization's IAM login page. This will be how members of the project log in to access the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
    - **Documentation**: Feel free to reference the [IAM Console and Sign-in Page documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console.html) for more help.
  - **Note**: You should also rename the template document to follow the naming convention `Organization_Name PL2 AWS Setup - Documentation`.
    - **Example**: `Colford_Group PL2 AWS Setup - Documentation` or `BCHT PL2 AWS Setup - Documentation`

5. In your web browser navigate to the [CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark Level 1 marketplace page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B078TPPXV2?qid=1549956548098&sr=0-5&ref_=srh_res_product_title) and subscribe your SPA account to the software.
  - **Note**: This step may take a few minutes to complete but the page will notify you when your account has been successfully subscribed.

6. Navigate to the [AWS Directory Service Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2/home?fromOldConsole=true&region=us-west-2#!/directories) and use it to create a new `Simple AD` that will have `Size = Small`, an `Organization Name` of your choosing, `Directory DNS Name = corp.example.com` and a password for the *Directory Administrator*. You should generate a password using the strong random password generator linked from your copy of the Documentation Template and document the password in the *Directory Administrator* section of the AWS Workspaces credentials table. During creation of the `Simple AD`, you should also select the default VPC and subnets `us-west-2a` and `us-west-2b`. This will take a few minutes to create.
  - **Documentation**: Feel free to reference additional documentation on ["What Gets Created"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/create_details_simple.html?icmpid=docs_ds_console_help_panel) when you create a directory with `Simple AD`.

7. Navigate to the [AWS Workspaces Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/home?region=us-west-2#listworkspaces:) and use it to create a "Standard" Windows 10 AWS Workspace called `Administration` in the US-West-2 (Oregon) region. Enable "Self Service Permissions" and "Amazon WorkDocs" and set the email to be your SPA email. The workspace should have a root volume capacity of 80GB and a user volume capacity of 0GB, both of which should be encrypted, and the "AutoStop (1 hour)" running mode is recommended. This can take up to 40 minutes to full create.
  - **Note**: Attempting to create the Terraform setup from outside the Workspace (which is within the same VPC as the EC2 Analysis Instance) will fail due to a VPC security group (firewall) configured only to allow access to the instance from within the VPC. Similarly, this ensures _your instance cannot be accessed from anywhere except one of the AWS workspaces that you set up_, and this is in an intentional design decision to ensure the data and instance stay secure. For advanced users attempting to change or modify this behaviour, see the `VPC` and `EC2` modules for more details.

8. As you wait for the Workspaces to initialize, navigate to the [`Directories` tab](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/home?region=us-west-2#directories:directories). You should see the directory you created earlier. Select the directory and `Update Details`. Select `Access to Internet` and enable internet access, if it is currently disabled.
  - **Note**: if you get the error `Internet Gateway not attached to your Amazon VPC`, navigate to the [AWS VPC Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-west-2#igws:sort=internetGatewayId) and create a new internet gateway. Leave the `Name tag` field blank. Then, select the newly created internet gateway and attach it to the default VPC to which your directory is also attached to. Finally, ensure the [VPC's route table](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-west-2#RouteTables:sort=routeTableId) to `Destination=0.0.0.0/0` targets the internet gateway you just spun up and its status is "Active".
    - **Documentation**: Feel free to reference additional documentation on [Creating a VPC, Internet Gateway and Subnet](https://campus.barracuda.com/product/emailsecuritygateway/doc/41099104/creating-a-vpc-internet-gateway-and-subnet/) and [AWS Routing 101](https://medium.com/@mda590/aws-routing-101-67879d23014d) for more help.


## Administration From an AWS Workspace

For the remainder of this section, you should be logged into your `Administration` AWS Workspace, which will be running Windows 10. To access your `Administration` workspace, you'll need to complete your user profile, [download an AWS Workspaces client](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/) for _your own device_ (i.e. a MacBook), and then login with username `Administration` and the password you've set (which you should record in the Documentation Template). See the email sent to your SPA email for more details and exact instructions.

1. **Workspace Setup**
  - Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (main web browser).
  - Install [Atom](https://atom.io) (main text editor).
  - Install [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) (version control & Terminal emulation).
  - Install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) (automated Infrastructure-as-a-service tool).
    - **Note**: Verify your installation is running smoothly by ensuring the behaviour in the installation documentation matches what happens on your machine.
      - **Documentation** Feel free to reference a step-by-step tutorial on [Installing Terraform on Windows 10](https://www.vasos-koupparis.com/terraform-getting-started-install/) for more help.
  - In a GitBash Terminal, type `ssh-keygen` to generate an SSH key pair for your `Administration` workspace
    - **Note**: The ssh key will be generated by default at the path `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and the public key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    - **Documentation**:Feel free to reference documentation on [Generating a New Key with ssh-keygen](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/) for more help.

2. **Setting Up Terraform**
  - From a GitBash Terminal, clone this GitHub repository onto your Workspace (command: `git clone https://github.com/kmishra9/PL2-AWS-Setup.git ~/Downloads/PL2-AWS-Setup`).
    - **Note**: This will create a folder called `PL2-AWS-Setup` in your Downloads folder
  - Then, open the GitHub repository in Atom (command: `atom ~/Downloads/PL2-AWS-Setup`)
  - In Atom, select `View > Toggle Soft Wrap` for better readability.
  - Next, open two existing files by double clicking them from the `Project` pane on the left: `variables.tf` and `example.tfvars.example`.
    - `variables.tf` includes a set of variable definitions, descriptions, and defaults.
    - `example.tfvars.example` is a skeleton which you will modify for your setup. On each line, a variable is defined to have some value (i.e. `project_name` has the value `"tf-test"` in the example file)
  - Rename `example.tfvars.example`. You can do so by right clicking the file in the `Project` pane on the left, selecting `Rename`, and specifying `terraform.tfvars` as the new name.
  - Finally, edit variable values in your new `terraform.tfvars` file to fit your requirements and save the result when you are done.
    - **Note**: The specific values you are responsible for assigning can have somewhat rigid requirements -- _read the documentation for each variable to prevent errors from occurring later_
    - **Note**: Remember to replace the fake Terraform IAM credentials with the ones you downloaded and documented earlier in the "Getting Started" section
    - **Documentation**: Feel free to reference the "Variable Files" section of [Terraform's documentation on input variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#Variable_Files) for more help.

3. **Running Terraform**
  - In a GitBash Terminal, navigate to this cloned GitHub repository (command: `cd ~/Downloads/PL2-AWS-Setup`).
  - Initialize Terraform (command: `terraform init`). This will take about a minute and Terraform will state it has been successfully initiated in bright green.
  - Next, start the automated build (command: `terraform apply`). This will take several minutes.
    - **Note**: if you get the error `* module.EC2.aws_instance.EC2_analysis_instance: timeout - last error: dial tcp 12.345.678.901:22: i/o timeout` try rerunning the command.
    - **Note**: if you get any other types of errors regarding resource creation or provisioning try running `terraform apply` once again, but if the issue doesn't resolve itself, report the issue on GitHub.
    - **Note**: Any files contained in `EC2/provisioner_scripts` will be copied to the EC2 Analysis Instance at the path `/home/ubuntu/` (the home directory of the first user, "Ubuntu") during Terraform's setup.

4. **Updating Your Documentation Template**
  - For all tables in your documentation template, you should now add the appropriate number of rows for researchers, and associate researcher names to their IAM, Workspaces, or Linux usernames. It's okay if other fields are blank for now -- we'll be filling them in as we go.
  - **Credentials for IAM Users**
    - Navigate to the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/home) and the "Logging Into the Console" section of your documentation template.
    - At this point, Terraform has generated IAM users for administrators, researchers, and log analysts, but hasn't yet assigned any of them passwords. For all newly created researcher and administrator accounts, you'll need to enable a `Console password`. You can do this by clicking on an IAM User from the [`Users` tab](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/users), selecting the `Security Credentials` tab, clicking the link to `Manage` the disabled `Console password`, and setting the password to an `Autogenerated password`.
    - Document this password for each user in the appropriate table and column
    - Enable "programmatic access" for the `Log_Analyst` IAM user, download the `secret_key` and `access_key`, and send them to UC Berkeley's Log Analysis Team
  - **EC2 Private IP**
    - Navigate to the [EC2 Management Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Instances:sort=desc:tag:Name) and the "First-Time Workspaces User Homework" section of your documentation template.
    - Select your EC2 Analysis Instance
    - Copy the `Private IP` and `Cmd-Shift-V` (retain formatting) it into your documentation template in the appropriate highlighted field and remove the highlight.
      - **Note**: You must use the Private IP -- if you accidentally copy the Public IP, you won't be able to connect

5. **Finishing Setup of your `Administration` Workspace**
  - **SSH Public Keys**
    - Document the ssh public key of `Administration` in your copy of the Documentation Template. It can generally be found at the path `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and can be printed to the console with the `cat` command (example: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`). Copy the public key and `Cmd-Shift-V` it into your documentation template in the appropriate highlighted field and remove the highlight. Because the key is long, you should shrink the public key down to a size 4 font as well.
  - **Configuring SSH Tunnels**
    - Follow the steps in the `README` contained within the [`workspaces/` directory](https://github.com/kmishra9/PL2-AWS-Setup/tree/master/workspaces) to set up SSH tunnelling to the EC2 Analysis Instance from the `Administration` Workspace.
      - **Note**: tunnelling works "out of the box", in that you don't need to do any additional setup on the server side. Terraform has already placed your Workspace's SSH Public Key in the `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server. For other users, _you_ will need to follow additional instructions (documented in a later step to "enable" SSH access for them.

## Final Touches

1. **AWS Workspaces for Researchers**
  - **Note**: At this point, an `Administration` workspace has been created but individual researchers will also need _their own workspaces_ in order to access the setup. Unfortunately, Terraform is unable to provision AWS Workspaces for each individual researcher automatically so you will need to create a separate Workspace for each researcher.
  - Follow the same steps you used to create the `Administration` Workspace to create Workspaces for each researcher.
    - **Note**: Each Workspaces username follows a standardized format, such as `Researcher_0` or `Researcher_11`, meaning you'll need to assign real people to these usernames in your copy of the Documentation Template as you create Workspaces for them.
    - **Note**: creating a workspace for each researcher will email them asking them to set up a password, just as the SPA email received one for the `Administration` Workspace.
  - Immediately after creating the Workspaces, send an email to all researchers receiving a workspace explaining what to do. Here is a [template email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18D-Rmr3Y5EkalVA8p9kLkrrsRvl12I-7RhPFeMy7fgc/edit?usp=sharing).
    - **Note**: in order to follow all instructions they are instructed to, they need to have several pieces of information in your project's copy of the documentation template, the most important of which is the highlighted `EC2_PRIVATE_IP` field

2. **Importing Data Into your AWS setup**
  - At a high level, secure data follows the same path that researchers do; it must hop from your computer (or an external source) to a `Workspace`, then to the EC2 Analysis Instance.
    - **Note**: It is important to remember is that this "hop" through the workspace is necessary because everything within the VPC (besides the Workspace itself) is isolated from the outside. A security group is applied to the EC2 Analysis Instance preventing any connections made from IPs outside of the VPC. Thus, directly connecting to the instance isn't an option.
  - **From Data Source to `Administration` Workspace**
    - The best ways to move data from the source to a workspace involve commercial cloud storage, such as [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or [Box](https://www.box.com/home), or the use of Amazon's custom solution, [AWS WorkDocs](https://aws.amazon.com/workdocs/). For data _already stored in the cloud_, it is easy to simply navigate to the data online and download it to the workspace.
    - For sensitive data _not already stored in the cloud_ (i.e. an encrypted hard drive in the office), the Amazon solution is particularly compelling, allowing the data to be synced from your own computer/hard drive to the Workspace. As part of creating the `Simple AD` directory in an earlier step, you should've enabled AWS WorkDocs and should see an existing WorkDocs site when you navigate to the [AWS WorkDocs Management Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/zocalo/home?region=us-west-2#/manage_organizations). Click on the link to start setting things up. Following setup, you can upload data to WorkDocs and [use Amazon WorkDocs Drive, in conjunction with your AWS Workspace](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/09/amazon-workspaces-users-can-now-use-amazon-workdocs-drive/).
      - [AWS WorkDocs Drive - User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/workdocs_drive_help.html).
  - **From `Administration` Workspace to EC2 Analysis Instance**
    - Once your data is accessible to you on the `Administration` Workspace, there are several ways to transfer it to the EC2 Analysis Instance. I'll outline three below.
      - **Note**: A reminder to run `./mount_drives` any time you start the EC2 Analysis Instance up (especially before you transfer the data). If you don't do this, the you'll be acidentally storing sensitive data on the (unencrypted) root volume of the instance at the path `/home/[data-folder-name]` instead of its correct place on an encrypted, attached, mounted EBS volume at that path.
      - **Method 1**: [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (Recommended)
        - Start by downloading and installing Cyberduck for Windows 10 on your Workspace using the link above. This is a free application and will allow you to transfer things relatively simply and easily.
        - Start by opening the Cyberduck application
        - Then, in the bottom left, click on the `+` button to add a bookmark and fill in the following fields:
          - Connection Type = `SFTP`
          - Nickname = `EC2 Analysis Instance`
          - Server = `[EC2_PRIVATE_IP]`
          - Port = `22`
          - Username = `ubuntu`
          - SSH Private Key = `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
        - Double-click the newly created bookmark and select `Allow` if necessary to continue with login. You should now be able to see files on the EC2 Analysis Instance and can upload and download to destinations by navigating around and using the `Action` button or by right-clicking.
        - **Documentation**: Feel free to reference an [additional tutorial on using Cyberduck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYDWOvyzoAQ) for more help.
      - **Method 2**: [RStudio Server Upload](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200713893-Uploading-and-Downloading-Files)
        - Read the documentation linked above. The RStudio Server upload function is limited to 1 file at a time, up to files 2GB or smaller. Thus, it is not the best solution for every data transfer, but is a good way to transfer some types of data easily and quickly.
        - Simply initiate an ssh tunnel from your Workspace, log into RStudio Server, and follow the directions in the documentation to upload data.
      - **Method 3**: [`scp`](http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php)
        - First, review the documentation linked above. Your Workspace will be the "local host" (where you will use your Terminal from, and where the data is stored), and the EC2 Analysis Instance will be the "remote host" (where you are connecting to and hope to deposit the data).
        - **Note**: It is possible to `scp` entire directories at once from the Workspace to the EC2 Analysis Instance.
        - **Example**: Let's say I have a `Data` folder full of many small files containing my data in the "Downloads" folder of my `Administration` Workspace. To transfer this data, I would start by opening my GitBash Terminal, navigating to my Downloads folder (command: `cd ~/Downloads`), and transferring it with `scp` (command `scp -r ~/Downloads/Data/ ubuntu@[EC2_PRIVATE_IP]:[DATA_FOLDER_PATH]`). Recall that the data folder path is `/home/[data-folder-name]`, where you specified the name of the data folder as part of Terraform setup.
      - When data has been transferred from the `Administration` Workspace to the EC2 Analysis Instance, _it needs to be deleted off the Workspace_.

  - **Big Data**
    - The approaches outlined above are likely to fit the vast majority of individual labs' use cases, and huge secure data, on the order of tens of terabytes and greater, is likely not the best fit for a setup like this. In these cases, we would recommend consulting with BRC (or your university's Research IT group) before proceeding.
  - **Backups**
    - I highly recommend you make a snapshot of both your root AWS EBS volume and the EBS volume containing sensitive data _prior_ to making large changes as well as a snapshot _after_ you successfully make the change.
    - This will help keep things running smoothly in the event that accidents happen (which they do).
    - Bricking an instance by accident, consequently, is only really bad if you don't have a straightforward path to recovery
    - For more information on how to make a backup


3. **MSSEI**
  - For PL2 projects only, you will also need to complete a document outlining your project and declaring that it fulfills the [Minimum Security Standards for Electronic Information (MSSEI)](https://security.berkeley.edu/minimum-security-standards-electronic-information) that your data must abide by.
  - You can find a Template MSSEI to begin filling out [here]().
  - An example of a similar, completed MSSEI can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YqaoR8Z0DrhGTk2_UBGsBcFsrapPVFUzkLbekPCxrOU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Administration in the Post-Terraform Era

1. **Adding a New Researchers to the Project**
