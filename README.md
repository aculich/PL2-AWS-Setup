## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts Terraform scripts that automatically set up a Protection Level 2 (PL2) High Performance Computing (HPC) environment in Amazon Web Services (AWS) for researchers working with secure big data. This environment is in use at UC Berkeley and is one of Berkeley Research Computing's Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions for researchers working with protected data.

Before beginning, it is recommended that you review the [PL2 AWS Setup - Generalized Cost Estimator for HPC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VL2TNQnx3wHRkHMnyBUlrT7jW5uFZfDGXvzLvSkOSPw/edit?usp=sharing) which projects expenses for a setup like this. If at any point you need assistance or would like to consult with our team on your project, please feel free to email the [BRC Consulting team](mailto:research-it-consulting@berkeley.edu). This guide is intended for the systems or security administrator of a project to use to build the setup. Finally, if you're interested in looking at and understanding this project's code, start with `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`, and `variables.tf` -- the [recommended minimal module files](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/create.html#standard-module-structure) -- and work your way from there.

**If at any point you run into any issues, have a question, a special use case, or need additional clarification and documentation, feel free to [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kmishra9/PL2-AWS-Setup/issues) and we'll do our best to handle it.**

---

## Getting Started

1. The first thing you'll need to do is [Set up AWS Invoicing at UC Berkeley](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cDSv0EzEkl09FVYivsTtvel1vyenoFJCDQTiECbGqT4/edit?usp=sharing).
  - **Note**: For researchers at other institutions, this involves simply setting up an AWS account with billing -- if your instituion has a particular method of AWS invoicing, it is recommended that you get that set up.
  - **Note**: At this point, ensure that the root AWS account is attached to a [Special Purpose Account (SPA)](https://calnetweb.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/special-purpose-accounts-spa), or for non-Berkeley folks, a project-specific email. This is to ensure there is a a central point of administration, helps with the separation of permissions, and ensures project's longevity is not tied to any one individual's account.
    - **Example**: `bcht-aws@berkeley.edu` or `brc-aws-dev@berkeley.edu`

2. Once you have created a SPA account, ensure you are able to [log into it](https://calnetweb.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/special-purpose-accounts-spa/log-spa) in an Incognito window.
  - From within your SPA, check out [bmail.berkeley.edu](bmail.berkeley.edu) and your SPA's [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
  - From within your SPA, make a copy of this [PL2 AWS Setup - Documentation Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzAM7vR4AbKNYL_YJ6qL6J2hG3W9ePVI67BPIZvl8RU/edit?usp=sharing), which is part of the recommended workflow for this project.
    - **Note**: As you proceed through the setup, this is a "one-stop-shop" for documenting pieces of the project that you have control over (such as usernames, passwords, public keys, etc.) that will be readily accessible and shareable among project members. This is useful from a systems administrator perspective and from a security audit perspective as well.
    - **Note**: You should share this document with anybody involved with the project but be careful with who has access because this document will contain sensitive information. Any researcher or administrator should definitely have read+write access but you should share with individual emails only (including your own, as you'll be responsible for filling it out), rather than sharing it as a link.

3. Next, log into using the services tab from your root account's AWS console, go to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) console. You will need to complete a set of 5 security tasks that are good practices for securing your root account, visible on the bottom of the dashboard. The 5 tasks are:
  - **Delete your root access keys** -- this is to ensure no program or person can use the root account key credentials to authenticate and thus makes [controlling access to the account much easier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html). Follow the steps on the dashboard.
  - **Activate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on your root account** -- this is to ensure that only the systems/security administrator has access to the root account. Follow the steps on the dashboard.
  - **Create individual IAM users** -- for now we only need to create a single IAM user to get Terraform set up. Once Terraform builds the setup, each researcher will be assigned their own individual IAM user automatically. Follow the [AWS documentation on Creating an Administrator IAM User and Group (Console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html). Once the user has been  created, be sure to use the `Download .csv` button to download this IAM user's credentials.
    - **Note**: you should name this user "Terraform" rather than "Administrator" for additional clarity. The group it is added should still be named "Administrators".
    - **Note**: at Step 4, rather than enable "Console access" and specify a password, you should check the box to enable "Programmatic access"
    - **Note**: if you don't download the IAM user's credentials immediately after creating them, they won't be available for download later. Instead, you would need to [Create a new Access Key](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/).
  - **Use Groups to assign permissions** -- ignore this for now -- Terraform will help us create IAM groups for researcher, administrators, and log analysts
  - **Apply an IAM Password Policy** -- ignore this for now -- Terraform will set this up to ensure that the passwords required to access the console by the researchers and admin are appropriately secure against standard brute-force and dictionary attacks.

4. Once you've done this, open your copy of the `PL2 AWS Setup - Documentation Template` and fill in the yellow-highlighted items in the document (some can be filled in now, others you should fill in as you work through the rest of the setup). As you fill these pieces in, unhighlight the sections.
  - **Note**: Make sure to document the Terraform IAM credentials you downloaded earlier!
  - **Note**: You should hyperlink [Account ID: <123456789012>]() so it looks like what appears here, where you replace the <Account ID> with your own and link to your organization's IAM login page. This will be how members of the project log in to access the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
    - **Documentation**: Feel free to reference the [IAM Console and Sign-in Page documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console.html) for more help.
  - **Note**: You should also rename the template document to follow the naming convention `Organization_Name PL2 AWS Setup - Documentation`.
    - **Example**: `Colford_Group PL2 AWS Setup - Documentation` or `BCHT PL2 AWS Setup - Documentation`

5. In your web browser navigate to the [CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark Level 1 marketplace page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B078TPPXV2?qid=1549956548098&sr=0-5&ref_=srh_res_product_title) and subscribe your SPA account to the software.
  - **Note**: This step may take a few minutes to complete but the page will notify you when your account has been successfully subscribed.

6. Navigate to the [AWS Directory Service Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2/home?fromOldConsole=true&region=us-west-2#!/directories) and use it to create a new `Simple AD` that will have `Size = Small`, an `Organization Name` of your choosing, `Directory DNS Name = corp.example.com` and a password for the *Directory Administrator*. You should generate a password using the strong random password generator linked from your copy of the Documentation Template and document the password in the *Directory Administrator* section of the AWS Workspaces credentials table. During creation of the `Simple AD`, you should also select the default VPC and subnets `us-west-2a` and `us-west-2b`. This will take a few minutes to create.
  - **Documentation**: Feel free to reference additional documentation on ["What Gets Created"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/create_details_simple.html?icmpid=docs_ds_console_help_panel) when you create a directory with `Simple AD`.

7. Navigate to the [AWS Workspaces Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/home?region=us-west-2#listworkspaces:) and use it to create a "Standard" Windows 10 AWS Workspace called `Administration` in the US-West-2 (Oregon) region. Enable "Self Service Permissions" and "Amazon WorkDocs" and set the email to be your SPA email. The workspace should have a root volume capacity of 80GB and a user volume capacity of 0GB, both of which should be encrypted, and the "AutoStop (1 hour)" running mode is recommended. This can take up to 40 minutes to full create.
  - **Note**: Attempting to create the Terraform setup from outside the Workspace (which is within the same VPC as the EC2 Analysis Instance) will fail due to a VPC security group (firewall) configured only to allow access to the instance from within the VPC. Similarly, this ensures _your instance cannot be accessed from anywhere except one of the AWS workspaces that you set up_, and this is in an intentional design decision to ensure the data and instance stay secure. For advanced users attempting to change or modify this behaviour, see the `VPC` and `EC2` modules for more details.

8. As you wait for the Workspaces to initialize, navigate to the [`Directories` tab](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/home?region=us-west-2#directories:directories). You should see the directory you created earlier. Select the directory and `Update Details`. Select `Access to Internet` and enable internet access, if it is currently disabled.
  - **Note**: if you get the error `Internet Gateway not attached to your Amazon VPC`, navigate to the [AWS VPC Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-west-2#igws:sort=internetGatewayId) and create a new internet gateway. Leave the `Name tag` field blank. Then, select the newly created internet gateway and attach it to the default VPC to which your directory is also attached to. Finally, ensure the [VPC's route table](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-west-2#RouteTables:sort=routeTableId) to `Destination=0.0.0.0/0` targets the internet gateway you just spun up and its status is "Active".
    - **Documentation**: Feel free to reference additional documentation on [Creating a VPC, Internet Gateway and Subnet](https://campus.barracuda.com/product/emailsecuritygateway/doc/41099104/creating-a-vpc-internet-gateway-and-subnet/) and [AWS Routing 101](https://medium.com/@mda590/aws-routing-101-67879d23014d) for more help.


## Administration From an AWS Workspace

For the remainder of this section, you should be logged into your `Administration` AWS Workspace, which will be running Windows 10. To access your `Administration` workspace, you'll need to complete your user profile, [download an AWS Workspaces client](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/) for _your own device_ (i.e. a MacBook), and then login with username `Administration` and the password you've set (which you should record in the Documentation Template). See the email sent to your SPA email for more details and exact instructions.

1. **Workspace Setup**
  - Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (main web browser).
  - Install [Atom](https://atom.io) (main text editor).
  - Install [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) (version control & Terminal emulation).
  - Install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) (automated Infrastructure-as-a-service tool).
    - **Note**: Verify your installation is running smoothly by ensuring the behaviour in the installation documentation matches what happens on your machine.
      - **Documentation** Feel free to reference a step-by-step tutorial on [Installing Terraform on Windows 10](https://www.vasos-koupparis.com/terraform-getting-started-install/) for more help.
  - In a GitBash Terminal, type `ssh-keygen` to generate an SSH key pair for your `Administration` workspace
    - **Note**: The ssh key will be generated by default at the path `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and the public key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    - **Documentation**:Feel free to reference documentation on [Generating a New Key with ssh-keygen](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/) for more help.

2. **Setting Up Terraform**
  - From a GitBash Terminal, clone this GitHub repository onto your Workspace (command: `git clone https://github.com/kmishra9/PL2-AWS-Setup.git ~/Downloads/PL2-AWS-Setup`).
    - **Note**: This will create a folder called `PL2-AWS-Setup` in your Downloads folder
  - Then, open the GitHub repository in Atom (command: `atom ~/Downloads/PL2-AWS-Setup`)
  - In Atom, select `View > Toggle Soft Wrap` for better readability.
  - Next, open two existing files by double clicking them from the `Project` pane on the left: `variables.tf` and `example.tfvars.example`.
    - `variables.tf` includes a set of variable definitions, descriptions, and defaults.
    - `example.tfvars.example` is a skeleton which you will modify for your setup. On each line, a variable is defined to have some value (i.e. `project_name` has the value `"tf-test"` in the example file)
  - Rename `example.tfvars.example`. You can do so by right clicking the file in the `Project` pane on the left, selecting `Rename`, and specifying `terraform.tfvars` as the new name.
  - Finally, edit variable values in your new `terraform.tfvars` file to fit your requirements and save the result when you are done.
    - **Note**: The specific values you are responsible for assigning can have somewhat rigid requirements -- _read the documentation for each variable to prevent errors from occurring later_
    - **Note**: Remember to replace the fake Terraform IAM credentials with the ones you downloaded and documented earlier in the "Getting Started" section
    - **Documentation**: Feel free to reference the "Variable Files" section of [Terraform's documentation on input variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#Variable_Files) for more help.

3. **Running Terraform**
  - In a GitBash Terminal, navigate to this cloned GitHub repository (command: `cd ~/Downloads/PL2-AWS-Setup`).
  - Initialize Terraform (command: `terraform init`). This will take about a minute and Terraform will state it has been successfully initiated in bright green.
  - Next, start the automated build (command: `terraform apply`). This will take several minutes.
    - **Note**: if you get the error `* module.EC2.aws_instance.EC2_analysis_instance: timeout - last error: dial tcp 12.345.678.901:22: i/o timeout` try rerunning the command.
    - **Note**: if you get any other types of errors regarding resource creation or provisioning try running `terraform apply` once again, but if the issue doesn't resolve itself, report the issue on GitHub.
    - **Note**: Any files contained in `EC2/provisioner_scripts` will be copied to the EC2 Analysis Instance at the path `/home/ubuntu/` (the home directory of the first user, "Ubuntu") during Terraform's setup.

4. **Updating Your Documentation Template**
  - For all tables in your documentation template, you should now add the appropriate number of rows for researchers, and associate researcher names to their IAM, Workspaces, or Linux usernames. It's okay if other fields are blank for now -- we'll be filling them in as we go.
  - **Credentials for IAM Users**
    - Navigate to the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/home) and the "Logging Into the Console" section of your documentation template.
    - At this point, Terraform has generated IAM users for administrators, researchers, and log analysts, but hasn't yet assigned any of them passwords. For all newly created researcher and administrator accounts, you'll need to enable a `Console password`. You can do this by clicking on an IAM User from the [`Users` tab](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/users), selecting the `Security Credentials` tab, clicking the link to `Manage` the disabled `Console password`, and setting the password to an `Autogenerated password`.
    - Document this password for each user in the appropriate table and column
    - Enable "programmatic access" for the `Log_Analyst` IAM user, download the `secret_key` and `access_key`, and send them to UC Berkeley's Log Analysis Team
  - **EC2 Private IP**
    - Navigate to the [EC2 Management Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Instances:sort=desc:tag:Name) and the "First-Time Workspaces User Homework" section of your documentation template.
    - Select your EC2 Analysis Instance
    - Copy the `Private IP` and `Cmd-Shift-V` (retain formatting) it into your documentation template in the appropriate highlighted field and remove the highlight.
      - **Note**: You must use the Private IP -- if you accidentally copy the Public IP, you won't be able to connect

5. **Finishing Setup of your `Administration` Workspace**
  - **SSH Public Keys**
    - Document the ssh public key of `Administration` in your copy of the Documentation Template. It can generally be found at the path `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and can be printed to the console with the `cat` command (example: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`). Copy the public key and `Cmd-Shift-V` it into your documentation template in the appropriate highlighted field and remove the highlight. Because the key is long, you should shrink the public key down to a size 4 font as well.
  - **Configuring SSH Tunnels**
    - Follow the steps in the [README](https://github.com/kmishra9/PL2-AWS-Setup/tree/master/workspaces) contained within the `workspaces/` directory to set up SSH tunnelling and continue.

6. **Finishing Setup of your EC2 Analysis Instance**

  - You will need to manually run each of the provided scripts when you log in for the first time for now. See [the README](https://github.com/kmishra9/PL2-AWS-Setup/tree/master/EC2/provisioner_scripts) contained within the `EC2/provisioner_scripts` directory to continue.
  - You should also document the Linux passwords of every newly created user. These are contained in a file in the Ubuntu home directory after you run the `add_users` script. You can display usernames and their passwords (command: `cat /home/ubuntu/add_users.log`).
  - **Other Installations**
    - If you have anything else you'd like to install, follow external instructions for installing things on `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS`, the OS the EC2 Analysis Instance is running
  - **MOVE ME TO A PORTION FOR AWS WORKSPACES FOR RESEARCHERS SSH Keys for Server Users**
    - - While you are SSH'd into the EC2 Analysis Instance, you should also document the SSH public keys of each user, including Ubuntu, the "sudo" user. These will be at `/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
      - **Note**: If that path doesn't exist yet, you will need to switch users (example: `sudo su researcher_0`) and run `ssh-keygen` for them, at which point a key pair should be generated for you to access and document. To become `ubuntu` again, simply type `exit` or `logout`. If you forget to switch users and run ssh-keygen as `ubuntu`, even from within the home directory of another user, you'll just be resetting `ubuntu`'s ssh keys. Make sure to update the documented key with the newly generated one if you do this accidentally.

## Final Touches

1. **AWS Workspaces for Researchers**
  - At this point, an `Administration` workspace has been created but individual researchers will also need their own workspaces in order to access the setup.
  - Unfortunately, Terraform is unable to provision AWS Workspaces for each individual researcher automatically so you will need to create a separate Workspace for each researcher
  - Follow the same steps you used to create the `Administration` Workspace to create Workspaces for each researcher. Researchers will receive an email asking them to set a password, just as the SPA email received one for the `Administration` Workspace. Ensure the researchers know to set passwords using the Strong Random Password Generator linked from your copy of the Documentation Template and to document the Workspaces passwords they generate there as well (there is a table associating a real name, workspaces username, and password where they should place their password). Researchers should also generate ssh keys and document their Workspaces ssh public key in the provided table as well.
    - **Note**: Each Workspaces username also follows a standardized format, such as `Researcher_0` or `Researcher_11`, meaning you'll need to assign real people to these usernames in your copy of the Documentation Template as you create Workspaces for them.
  -

2. **Adding New Researchers after Terraform has been built**

3. **Importing Data Into your AWS setup**
  - The recommended workflow for importing data involves transferring the data to a new `Data_Acquisition` AWS Workspace that you create especially for this purpose There are a variety of ways to do this such as Box, Google Drive, AWS WorkDocs scp, sftp, etc. Then, from `Data_Acquisition` you could transfer the data to your EC2 Analysis Instance via [SCP (a terminal command)](http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php) or something like [Cyberduck (a GUI)](https://cyberduck.io/).
    - **Note**: It is important to remember is that this "hop" through the workspace is necessary because everything within the VPC (besides the Workspace itself) is isolated from the outside. A security group is applied to the EC2 Analysis Instance preventing any connections made from IPs outside of the VPC. Thus, directly connecting to the instance isn't an option.
  - **Note**: I highly recommend you make a snapshot of both your root AWS EBS volume and the EBS volume containing sensitive data _prior_ to making large changes as well as a snapshot _after_ you successfully make the change. This will help keep things running smoothly in the event that accidents happen (which they do). Bricking an instance by accident, consequently, is only really bad if you don't have a straightforward path to recovery
  - **Note**: A reminder to run `./mount_drives` any time you start the EC2 Analysis Instance up. You don't want to acidentally store sensitive data on the root volume of the instance at the path /home/[data-folder-name] (which is unencrypted) instead of its correct place on an encrypted, attached, mounted EBS volume at that path.

4. **MSSEI**
  - For PL2 projects only, you will also need to complete a document outlining your project and declaring that it fulfills the [Minimum Security Standards for Electronic Information (MSSEI)](https://security.berkeley.edu/minimum-security-standards-electronic-information) that your data must abide by.
  - You can find a Template MSSEI to begin filling out [here]().
  - An example of a similar, completed MSSEI can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YqaoR8Z0DrhGTk2_UBGsBcFsrapPVFUzkLbekPCxrOU/edit?usp=sharing).
